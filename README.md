# CustomGazeboSimulation
This is a custom world I created for the project of warehouse patrolling using Turtlebot3. I used ROS2 Humble and Turtlebot3 package to spawn the turtlebot and navigate inside the custom world. This is stll under development with the world being built and navigation being figured out. Integration of the two is to be done.
